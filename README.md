# Eko (エコ) — AI-Powered Transparency in Fashion

EKO is an AI-powered transparency layer built at Strategy x DevHacks’25 to tackle greenwashing in the fashion industry. The platform calculates product-level sustainability and wellness scores using certified standards and heuristics, enabling brands and consumers to see the real impact of what they wear.
